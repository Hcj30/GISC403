	<h1>Capturing change over time</h1>

	<p>The Ōtākaro Living Laboratory uses rephotography to capture the changes occuring in the post-earthquake landscape of Ōtautahi Christchurch. We capture repeat photographs every three months - replicating position, elevation, and orientation – at 31 places in the corridor in order to create a long-term record of climate and social related changes. This map showcases the six key neighborhoods where this occurs: Avon Loop, Richmond, Dallington, Burwood, New Brighton, and Bexley, with an example from each.</p>	  

	<p>The design choices for this map were centered around improving its clarity and maximizing visual impact. The base map style has been customized by matching water and land colors to the existing Living Lab palette, with the intention of accentuating the water elements. To streamline the map's appearance, points of interest labeling (bright orange markers) have been disabled and unnecessary walking and cycling tracks removed, reducing visual noise. Suburb labels have been enlarged for better legibility, and the font made consistent (using Asap font) across all map elements. A red zone area (shapefile) has been included, filtered to exclude areas outside Ōtautahi to maintain relevance. In the web map interface, a custom icon suitable for rephotography has been added, and the area of interest polygon has been styled with black color, fine weight, and a subtle fill, to resemble a lens. Territorial authority boundaries have been styled with a white color and transparent fill for a clean and unobtrusive appearance.</p>
