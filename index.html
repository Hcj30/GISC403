	<h1>Ōtākaro Living Laboratory (OLL)</h1>
	<p>The Ōtākaro Living Laboratory (OLL) is a local initiative situated within the Ōtākaro Avon River Corridor in Ōtautahi Christchurch. Its core objective is to establish a cutting-edge living laboratory, serving as a center for learning, experimentation, and research aimed at addressing climate change challenges.</p>

	<p>The OLL uses rephotography to capture changes over time in the post-earthquake landscape of Ōtautahi. Rephotography involves taking repeat photographs of the same view at different time intervals, replicating position, elevation, and aspect/orientation. Rephotography is a long-term record of visual change, which engages local (and international) communities in climate change awareness, by drawing our attention to significant environmental processes that we may not notice are changing. The river corridor comprises 31 active sites, across six neighborhoods: the Avon Loop, Richmond, Dallington, Burwood, New Brighton, and Bexley.</p>
