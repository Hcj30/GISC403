Description: The Ōtākaro Living Laboratory uses rephotography to capture the changes occuring in the post-earthquake landscape of Ōtautahi Christchurch. We capture repeat photographs every three months - replicating position, elevation, and orientation – at 31 places in the corridor in order to create a long-term record of climate and social related changes. This map showcases the six key neighborhoods where this occurs: Avon Loop, Richmond, Dallington, Burwood, New Brighton, and Bexley, with an example from each.
