The Ōtākaro Living Laboratory captures the evolving landscape of Ōtautahi Christchurch post-earthquake using rephotography. Every three months, we replicate photos at 31 key locations, preserving a visual record of climate and social changes. This map highlights six neighborhoods: Avon Loop, Richmond, Dallington, Burwood, New Brighton, and Bexley.
